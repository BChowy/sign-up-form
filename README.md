## Project Overview

Sign-up form project themed after the 'Fight Club' movie.

## Progress

I've worked on the following features:
- **Validate user input:** The form tests each input to check if it follows the expected format.
- **Custom error messages:** The form shows customized error messages rather than the browser's default.
- **Responsiveness:** Made the form to be fluid for different sizes of desktops.

## Learnings

I learned about the 'blur' event listener but used 'keyup' to be more user-friendly and have clear error messages.
I had to validate the form when the button clicked to submit the form, and it was a bit challenging as I didn't know how to approach the problem, but I found a way to solve it using a loop.
